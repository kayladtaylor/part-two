# Week Two: Reflections

I would like to start this reflection off by stating that I had a bit of difficulty with understanding and connecting with the readings this week. I had to do a bit of googling to try and understand a lot of what was being said. (Not sure if I'm the only one but I had no idea what was meant by crowdsourcing- though after I googled it, I felt silly because I have heard the term in previous classes.)

Again, this week I found the twitter thread particularly interesting and it was a good place to start for some background-like reading for the rest of the materials this week. I never would have thought that so much time, resources and thought went behind digitizing primary sources. In the age of social media everything is uploaded so quickly. I can literally scan documents with my phone and upload them. It's also notable that in this age not much isn't on the internet and a lot of it is uploaded without permission. So for organizations to have to go through so much in order to ensure that history can be more accessible was a little shocking. Between having curators, a Rights team, and conservation team, there is a lot going on to digitize.<SUP>1</SUP>

Also worth noting the insanity that is "_Transcribe Bentham_" project! It's amazing to be able to transcribe/ preserve Bentham's manuscripts, but it is absolutely insane the amount of document that is apart of this project. The team launched the initiative in 2010 and as of today they (_with the help of crowdsourcing_) have completed **56%** of Bentham's manuscripts, **thats 22 000 pages!** <SUP>2</SUP>

I also continued on reading through their sight to the "_Transkribus, HTR and Medieval Latin abbreviations_", I'm not entirely sure if that was expected of us or not. I found it really interesting though! I'm not going to sit here and pretend to understand or know what they were talking about while trying out different methods of transcribing, but I found it really inspiring the amount of times they've failed to get the results they hoped for, but pushed forward and tried again. They reached out for help when they got stuck or needed insight. Something that I really need to learn how to do better. I also think it's insanely neat that they've had success in being able to use _transkribus_ to translate and identify over 100 Latin abbreviations, making it a lot easier and more efficient to transcribe sources.<SUP>3</SUP>

Through these readings I learnt that, other than library and archives, whose jobs it is to put these documents online, most of the other work only have a small amount of funding through universities, and relay on _crowdsourcing_. People who volunteer to do the work for free.

I'm not entirely sure what is meant by _"Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you?"_ Through MacOdrum library and other resources we can access through the university, we do get a lot of online resources and I do believe that since covid they have made more resources available to us. I've never had any issues with accessing any of the resources through Carleton, most come in PDF format or others can be viewed online.

_What is the value of regular historians showing their work?_ There is reason to continue traditional methods of history. The research paper shows methodology and process in acquiring information, as well as showing theoretical lenses that may be applied to analyzing history. There is value to historians documenting their methods, as well as applying theory to their works, in order to better explain the data. However, from reading the two articles by _"JWBAKER"_, a lot goes into what digital historians have to do. From what I can gather, digital historians do more raw work, I liked this quote in the  "_Hard Digital History That Underpins My Book"_ by _JWBAKER_:

    _"As I always tell my students, good History writing is concise, precise, and selective: not telling your reader everything you know is central to how we present interpretations of the past. The point is, I didnâ€™t leave this digital stuff out because it was digital but rather because leaving stuff out is what we do in the process of turning research into publication."_<SUP>4</SUP>
